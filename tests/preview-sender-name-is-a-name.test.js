// An operator's Intro DM preview signed off:

//   Thanks,

//
// /api/templates/preview had no live GoLogin session, so it stood the raw
// profile id in for the account's name: `const pName = profileId`. That line was
// there since the endpoint was written — the August fix for the same symptom
// covered the account tiles in the app window, never this.
//
// Worse than ugly: a preview that doesn't match what will be sent HID the real
// problem, which was the template using {senderName} where {senderFirstName}
// was meant.
