# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Variable fix must deploy before voice selection (broken foundation risk)
- TTS override dashboard toggle is a prerequisite for voice features
- Non-destructive per-recipient voice override (not agent-level PATCH)
- [Phase 01]: All 14 dynamic variables confirmed present in agent prompt — no PATCH needed
- [Phase 02]: Manual URL for /v2/voices avoids elevenlabsGet v1 prefix bug
- [Phase 02]: getUserProperties for per-user voice preference isolation
- [Phase 02]: Conditional voice override: omit conversation_config_override entirely when no voice selected

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 voice preview: CORS behavior in GAS sandboxed iframes is uncertain. May need server-side audio proxying.
- PropertiesService scope (getUserProperties vs getScriptProperties) needs clarification during Phase 2 planning.
