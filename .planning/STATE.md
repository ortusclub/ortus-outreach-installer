## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Variable fix must deploy before voice selection (broken foundation risk)
- TTS override dashboard toggle is a prerequisite for voice features
- Non-destructive per-recipient voice override (not agent-level PATCH)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 voice preview: CORS behavior in GAS sandboxed iframes is uncertain. May need server-side audio proxying.
- PropertiesService scope (getUserProperties vs getScriptProperties) needs clarification during Phase 2 planning.
