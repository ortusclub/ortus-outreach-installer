/**
 * GoLogin accounts registry — the app talks to MORE THAN ONE GoLogin account.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-07 there was exactly one: a single `GOLOGIN_API_TOKEN` read
 * straight out of the environment at ~30 call sites, with nothing anywhere
 * recording which account a profile came from. Linked Velocity is a separate
 * GoLogin plan whose profiles cannot be shared into the Ortus workspace, so
 * "which account owns this profile" had to become a real, tracked fact.
 *
 * The model, deliberately kept small:
 *   - Accounts are declared HERE, hard-coded, exactly like the sheet config in
 *     sheets-webapp-url.js — every operator's build must agree on the roster.
 *     Only the secrets come from the environment.
 *   - A profile belongs to whichever account's API listed it
 *     (see gologin-launcher.getProfiles, which tags every profile).
 *   - An OPERATOR belongs to whichever account matches their login email
 *     domain. That is the whole access rule: an @ortusclub.com login can use
 *     Ortus profiles, an @linkedvelocity.com login can use Linked Velocity
 *     profiles. Everyone still SEES both — the other account's profiles render
 *     in the picker marked unavailable, so the roster stays legible to all.
 *
 * There is no runtime switcher and no per-operator override. Domain is the
 * single source of truth precisely because it cannot be silently mis-set: a
 * shared server with two operators signed in at once still resolves each one's
 * account correctly, which a global "active account" toggle could not.

// token; an account with no token configured is simply absent at runtime

// exists behaves exactly like the old single-account app.
// A pseudo-mode for Post Amplification. It is not a campaign mode — it runs
// through /api/post-amplification/start, not the campaign wizard — but the
// account rules have to talk about it, so it gets a name alongside the real
