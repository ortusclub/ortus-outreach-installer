 * connection of the primary person. Before a CC+IC account starts its turn we
 * navigate to the primary's profile, read the connection-degree badge, and — on
 * the first check only — send a bare connect request to the primary if the
 * account isn't already connected. While an account is unconnected its intros
 * are held (see campaign.js); each subsequent turn re-reads the degree and
 * releases the intros once it flips to 1st-degree.
 *
 * Pure browser helper: reuses the exported sendConnectionRequest. Does NOT
 * modify the off-limits action/outreach files.
