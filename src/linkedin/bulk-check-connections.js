 * so acceptances that fall off LinkedIn's ~80-most-recent window are still
 * remembered. Matched rows get Connected Status = 'Connected' written back
 * via the existing batchUpdate path.
 *
 * Match keys (any one hits): LinkedIn public-id slug, ACoAA member id (URN),
 * or first+last name — each attributed to the owning campaign Sender (the
 * `account` field). "Is this lead connected?" is answered from the account
 * that owns the connection in the tab, not from which profile is sweeping:
 * the row's assigned Sender owning it → Connected; only a different campaign
 * sender owning it → "Already connected to <that account>".
 *
 * Caller is responsible for cooldown gating + navigating the page to a
 * LinkedIn URL before invoking (so JSESSIONID is present for Voyager).
